        <h2>MacBook Air</h2>
        <p>The MacBook Air is a line of laptop computers developed and manufactured by Apple since 2008. It features a thin, light structure in a machined aluminum case and a 13-inch screen. The Macbook Air's lower prices relative to the larger, higher performance MacBook Pro have made it Apple's entry-level notebook since the discontinuation of the original MacBook line in 2011. The MacBook Air is a line of Macintosh notebook computers developed and manufactured by Apple. Since 2020, the Air has employed custom-designed systems-on-a-chip, called the Apple M series. In the current product line, the MacBook Air is Apple's entry-level notebook, situated below the performance range MacBook Pro, and is currently sold with 13-inch screens (13.3-inch for the M1 model and 13.6-inch for the M2 model). Apple released the MacBook Air with the Apple M1 system on a chip in November 2020. A redesigned model based on the Apple M2 chip was released in July 2022.
